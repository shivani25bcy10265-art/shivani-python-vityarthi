PASSWORD ANALYZER

This repository hosts a Password Strength Analyzer, a utility designed to provide users with immediate and meaningful feedback on the strength of their passwords. It has a strong system for calculating the true security level of your password and assign a strength score, helping developers and users encourage the use of strong, unique passwords.
This Python-based command-line tool assesses the security level of a given password by evaluating factors like length, character diversity.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Our current password rules are like a simple checklist that says, "You must be 8 characters long and have a capital letter," which is easy for hackers to get around (like the weak password "school name 12"). The smarter approach uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), which acts like a highly trained expert. This expert doesn't just check the rules; it analyzes millions of cracked passwords to learn what really makes one strong, like the overall randomness and patterns. It then gives your password a real-world risk score—predicting how many years it would actually take a supercomputer to guess it—moving us from a basic, easily fooled security system to a dynamic defense that can spot and block even the newest, trickiest attacks.


FEATURES AND LOGICS

The analyzer scores a password out of a total of 100 points based on the following criteria:

* Length Bonus (25 points) -> Awarded if the password meets or exceeds the minimum length (10 characters). Partial points are given for lengths greater than 6 and 8. 

* Uppercase Letters (15 points) -> Awarded for the inclusion of at least one uppercase letter (A-Z). 

* Lowercase Letters (15 points) -> Awarded for the inclusion of at least one lowercase letter (a-z). 

* Digits (20 points) -> Awarded for the inclusion of at least one digit (0-9). 

* Special Characters (25 points) -> Awarded for the inclusion of at least one symbol/punctuation mark (e.g., !@#$%^&*). 

* Penalty: Detects and penalizes simple, common sequences like 'abc', '123', 'zyx', and '987'.

* Repetition Penalty: Detects and penalizes repeated characters (e.g., 'aaa', '111').

RATING SYSTEMS

The final score is translated into an easy-to-understand rating:

* 90 - 100 -> Strong Password

* 75 - 89 -> Moderate Strength 

* 50 - 74 -> Weak, needs more strength 

* 25 - 49 -> Very weak, need much more improvement 

* < 25 -> Not Valid, Retry 

TECHNOLOGIES / TOOLS USED

Core Language: Python 3.x

Standard Library: string (used for character sets like punctuation and alphabet).

Tools: Standard command-line interface (CLI) for input/output.


STEPS TO RUN THE CODE

Since this project uses only the standard Python library (string), no external installations are required.

1. Save the Code

Save the entire code block provided into a file named password_analyzer.py.

2. Run the Script

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Execute the script using Python:

bash
python password_analyzer.py


3. Enter Password

The program will prompt you to enter the password you wish to analyze:


### AI-Enhanced Password Strength Analyzer ###
Enter the password :


Type your password and press Enter to see the results, score, and security rating.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

If you enter a password like hello:


### password analysis ###
analyzed password : hello
final score of the inputted password : 30 / 100
rating of the inputted password : very weak, need much more improvement

### suggestions for improvement ###
--> add some upper case words
--> add some digits
--> add some characters
--> length of password is too small, suggested length = 10 


PROJECT STRUCTURE

1.  analyze(password): The core function that iterates through the password, checks for character types (upper, lower, digits, special characters), calculates the score based on the weightage dictionary, and generates detailed feedback.
2.  rate(score): Translates the final numeric score into a readable string rating using defined if/elif logic.
3.  result(password, score, feedback): Displays the final, formatted output to the user, including the score, rating, and all suggestions.
4.  main(): The entry point that takes user input and plans the calls to analyze and result.
