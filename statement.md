# Problem Statement
With the increasing number of online accounts, users often create weak passwords that are vulnerable to attacks such as brute force, dictionary attacks, and social engineering. There is a need for a tool that can analyze the strength of passwords and provide actionable feedback to help users create more secure passwords.

- IT professionals and security enthusiasts
- Organizations seeking to educate employees about password security

# High-level Features
- Analyze password strength based on multiple criteria
- Provide a numeric score and qualitative feedback
- Suggest improvements for weak passwords
